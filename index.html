                <h2>Samarkand</h2>
                <p>There is evidence of human activity in the area of 
                   the city dating from the late Paleolithic Era. Though
                   there is no direct evidence of when Samarkand was
                   founded, several theories propose that it was founded 
                   between the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Prospering from its
                   location on the Silk Road between China, Persia and Europe,
                   at times Samarkand was one of the largest[4] cities in Central Asia,
                   and was an important city of the empires of Greater Iran.By
                   the time of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, it was the capital of the 
                   Sogdian satrapy. The city was conquered by Alexander the Great in
                   329 BC, when it was known as Markanda, which was rendered in Greek
                   as Μαράκανδα. The city was ruled by a succession of Iranian and Turkic 
                   rulers until it was conquered by the Mongols under Genghis Khan in 1220.</p>
